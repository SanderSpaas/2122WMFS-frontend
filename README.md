## Getting started

This is a SPA that allows you to play Gotcha. You will need backend too that can be found here: https://gitlab.com/ikdoeict/sander.spaas/2122wmfs-backend 


## Installing the project
Make sure to set the VITE_API_BASE variable in you .env file to the right one.
Then just use your terminal of choice to navigate to GotchaFrontEnd and npm install the depencies.
From there just run npm run build.
Now you can put your build online and connect it with the backend.
